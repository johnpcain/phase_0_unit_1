// Reflection:
// Write your reflection here.

// What is this referring to? Think programming-wise rather than in the terms of the game. 
// "this" is referring to the object that the methods we called in the game were nested as properties

// What does the () do in JavaScript? The () offers arguments that can be applied when calling a method. Empty parentheses signify that no arguments apply to the method being called.

// What is the point of the semicolons? Semicolons separate statements within a js code. Semicolons are required whenever two statements are used on the line, but 
// but are not required if a line break separate two statements. semicolons should not be used after curly brackets or round brackets of an if, for while, or 
// switch statement. Apart from these exceptions, code is generally easier to read and parse when semicolons are used inbetween statements.
