# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0?

I had some trouble in the first week with time management - as a noob in every sense of the term, I kept finding myself wasting a lot of time trying to troubleshoot easy problems and spending two or three times the amount of time on a challenge than I had allocated. 

* How will you combat that? 

I think time allocation will get easier as I develop a better base understanding of coding, but I plan on using a few methods:
	1. Make a conscious effort to improve my ability to focus
	2. Taking forced, timed breaks throughout a period of work
	3. Minimizing distractions. Turning off the phone, signing out of Facebook, etc.

* What techniques will you try?

	I legitimately want to try meditation now. I had no idea that it had such an impact on your brain activity. I'm also going to try taking "zen walks." The pomodoro technique also sounds interesting. 

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

My overall plan is to spend the earlier part of each week completing the challenges and spending the remainder of the week doing external research to develop my understanding of the skills required for the week's tasks. I think a big part of what we're learning at DBC is the importance of individual research and continual learning. Best to start those habits sooner rather than later in my opinion. Similar to George, I plan on taking a few weekend road trips to see some coastal cities that I haven't been to before.
