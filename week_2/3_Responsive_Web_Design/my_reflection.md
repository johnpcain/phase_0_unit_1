# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

Responsive web design is a css practice that allows the formatting to change depending on the screen that the user is viewing the web page on. With RWB, a developer only needs to code a web page once, as oppoed to having a web version, tablet version, mobile version, etc. 

I think it's a good idea. We're in the age of customization, so the potential viewing devices will only multiply, giving the developer less control over the user experience. 

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

Smartphone and tablets have changed web design in many ways. To name a few:

1. The content needs to be more interactive, as the user is touching the screen as opposed to scrolling a web page. 
2. The content needs to be less text heavy, as the user is viewing the content on a smaller screen
3. The content needs to be more immediately engaging - often times, if we're on our phones or tablets, we're on the go and have less time to read through a web page for relevant content. 

I think web design, at its core, enables a user to interact with information. We are all very unique in how we like to interact with information, as evidenced by the varying learning styles we all have. I think new technology will provide more options for interacting with content and web design will be faced with the juggling the dual challenges of offering content that is familiar across devices, but also is formatted with the device in mind. 

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?


Interesting. A visually impaired person would rely on touch and sound to interact with the web. Similar to how a hearing impaired person relies on sight to communicate with people, a visually impaired person could rely on hearing to communicate with a computer. The computer could make a recognizable sound that the user could associate with a word, phrase, or some sort of content. The keyboard could have more indentations that enable the user to better feel their place on the keybaord. 

I believe we should. Technology enables many people to better their lives through convenience, increased productivity, better communication, etc. and I feel that any person should be entitled to similar benefits. 

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

I'm honestly not at the point yet where I understand enough to offer any criticisms. Ask me again in a few weeks maybe? 

As to what has resonated, i'm honestly in awe of the "magic" of how so many different complex parts are in constant communication with one another in order to show me the web page that i'm viewing. The more I understand about the web, networks, html, css, and javascript only further develops that appreciation. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

None to report.
