# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: johnpcain.github.io

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? I learned that web development and web design and interconnected and must operate in conjunction and consideration of one another to develop a product that develops an exceptional user experience (UX). UX is tough for me to verbalize, because it seems so obvious, but at the same time is overlooked so frequently. UX design says that the UX needs to be considered in every step of the development and design process - from wireframing to polishing. The UX can be negatively impacted by a number of things, to name a few -  a cluttered web page, slow loading times due to large files or improperly ordered elements in html, difficult navigation, etc. 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
	I felt like I didn't get to deeply consider UX in this challenge, due to the simplicity of the web page. My consideration of UX was as follows -- what web sites do I visit that I feel provide a great UX -- why do they provide a great UX -- what inspiration can I draw from their layout? design elements? 
	Wireframing was fun, coding the site was fun, toying around with the CSS to get the web page looking how I wanted it to.... not so fun. 
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
	three steps: wireframe/UX, rough code, polish code. The first step went well. The initial html coding went well; however, when I went to rough code in CSS I found myself worrying about the polish or finese elements before I had even finished getting the elements in the right spot on the page. I need to work on a better structure for rough CSS coding. 
* What would you like to add or change about the site next? better font, nav bar, column title bars, more color
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool? Just discovered snippets in sublime text 2....mind blown. 
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it. None to report
