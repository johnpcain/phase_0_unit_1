## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. I learned that the web is not analogous to the internet, but is in fact a collection of all web pages that are interpreting data received from the internet to present it in a usable and navigable format. I also learned that web sites are static and require only HTML and CSS, while web applications require databases and often times javascript (which is different from java!). 
2. Some important things to remember: 
- ask yourself how your website will be used, and determine what kinds of content and media will the site require. 
- ask yourself how often the website needs to be updated, and whether the user is providing some of the content 
- be sure to properly describe every change you make to the repository when committing

5. None to list
