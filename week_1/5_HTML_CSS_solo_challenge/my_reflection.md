1. Questions I asked
	- Why use relative/absolute positioning instead of simply using margin positioning? I found this answer on stackoverflow.com 
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16050924/why-not-use-margin-positioning-instead-of-using-positionrelative-top-5px
	- It seems like left/right positioning is always specified, but top/bottom not mentioned. It part of the default to relatively center an element?
	- Does the only text a span function applies to have to sit between the <span> and </span>?
2. I'm having trouble fully grasping what establishes positioning on the webpage. I think this would be resolved I could just play around with different commmands, better understand what establishes the container block that an element refers to. 
3. Yes - plently. blockquotes, scans, ids, etc. I have a better understanding of how CSS and HTML connect and relate to one another as well
4. Pretty confident I would say. Again, the only thing I couldn't speak intelligently to would be the positioning 
5. Setting up the HTML structure and playing around in CSS
6. Trying to decide where code should go in the structure. For instance, does a blockquote go inside the paragraph, or inside simply the header?
