## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. The imbedded nature of elements makes a lot of sense to me. The structure and organiztaion that accompany a page layout makes editing  the content easier. 
2. Good - organization, structure, easy to understand and pick up. Once you understand the general framework you have a base understanding that you can build off of and reference back to if you get lost or run into a problem. 
	Bad - I haven't come across any aspects of HTML that I would say are bad, but this is my first time using the program and that will likely change. 
3. I now feel much more confident dissecting a website and understanding the basics of the page layout. 
4. None to list
